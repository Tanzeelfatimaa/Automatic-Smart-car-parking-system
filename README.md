# Automatic-Smart-car-parking-system
The main problem in today's crowded parking facility is congestion and finding a vacant parking space. Looking at the current scenario in parking system, it is observed that it efficient at all. The current parking areas have no management system 1.e. people randomly park their vehicles in these large parking areas according to their convenience on either entry or exit. And also it is not easy for a car driver entering a large parking facility to know which parking zones are vacant.Moreover once the car is stuck in a congested area, it even takes even longer time to get out of the area. This leads to greater time consumption and
requires more manual labour. Also, this causes traffic jams and sometimes wastage of parking spots leading to lesser revenue generation. In this project we have designed for vehicle parking and the main aim of this project is to atomize the vehicle park for allowing the vehicles into the park.
